# AB3D2 TKG Redux Plotline Ideas

## Backgound

### Escape

Commander Reynolds, sole human survivor of the Osiris III incident has escaped in an emergency shuttle:

 - The desperate launch and lack of proper preparation means the shuttle has broken free of the planetary gravity well but does not have the reaction mass left to correct the current trajectory and enter a stable parking orbit around the planet.
 - The ship is now in an long eliptical orbit around Osiris.
 - Ill-equipped for a prolongued flight, he is left with no choice but to record a brief distress message, reconfigure the systems for minimum power operation and go into the hibernation pod. With a daily distress call, the total remaining energy reserves should last at most 80-100 days.

Unknown to him, the Indomitable was already in the system:
- Running dark.
- Long range sensors and inserts had been collecting data since well before the outbreak.
- Dispatched by the EAB (Exoplanet Assetisation Bloc), _de facto_ owners of the system weeks before the outbreak.
- Orders to observe, contain the outbreak and if necessary, destroy all traces of the installation.
- The escape shuttle was unexpected but also subject to a contingency plan.

### Rescue

Having completed its primary mission, the Indomitable interdicts the escape shuttle and recovers the unconscious Reynolds:
- Reynolds is to be quarantined, kept in hibernation and brought back to LV-622 for "enhanced debrief".

## LV-622

LV-622, aka _Set_ is the Primary Hub for the EAB's advanced projects division, situated approximately centre of a local group of assetised systems:

- Minimally habitable, "super-Mars":
    - Water-scarce terrestrial planet with a comparatively thin atmosphere.
    - Dotted with lakes and smaller seas in low-lying depressions but otherwise mostly rocky desert.
    - Planetwide EAB installations, connected by long range teleporter relays, intended to enhance physical isolation between locations dealing with hazardous materials.
    - Named after the brother and murderer of Osiris in ancient Egyptian mythology, deity of chaos and desert.
 
- The Indomitable arrives at LV-622 and docks with one of the major low orbit stations that support surface to orbit teleportation.


## Level A: The Awakening

Some undisclosed length of time after the arrival at LV-622, Reynolds awakens in the quarantined medical bay of the Indomitable. Unaware of the Indomitable's original mission, he assumes he has been rescued.

Level begins in the medical bay:
- Basic blaster and shotgun located close by.
- Immediate area introduces collectables, locks, doors, crouching and jumping concepts.
- Wall panel display shows a lockdown is in effect.
- Soon becomes obvious the ship has been infected by the breed.

Beyond the quarantine isolation door an artium section contains an (almost) fully sealed isolation bulkhead door preventing access to the forwawrd teleport section. The level exit doors connect to one of the umbilicals through which the ship is attached to the station, which requires a key. The only other route is through a systems section that follow the original level layout.

- Reynolds must find the key to open this door to complete the level.
- Original level access to the bridge is a dead end, with another isolation door engaged.
- A locked door requiring a red key provides an alternative route to the forward section of the main atrium.
- The concepts of door keys, bridges and teleports are introduced here.

The ship's bridge section on the flight deck is now only accessible by teleport:
- More situational information is given.
- Displays reveal the current location (LV-622) and a drone view of the docking ring.
- Armoury section is initially locked.
- Completion of the flight deck section permits telportation back to the systems section.
- Introduces the concept of secret areas and some slightly more challenging enemies.


## Level B: Docking Ring

Exiting Level A leads through the umbilical to one of the numerous levels in the docking ring of the orbital station.

- Continuity is maintained, the initial area of the level visually matches the exit of the preceding level.
- A situational display reveals that quarter of the ring has been sealed and vented to space, intimating heavy damage to that area.
- Remaining entrances to the inner maintenance and cargo handling sections of the ring are locked, requiring a key to open.
- Key lowers lift in the cargo section and also unlocks the doors currently blocking access.
- Introduces heavy mechanoid (headlight robot) and additional seceret area mechanisms, e.g. shoot doors.
- Introduces drone enemy (replaces triclaw).
- A large situational display shows that the station is on auxilliary power and will deorbit due to atmospheric drag if primary power is not restored. Imtimation of intentional sabotage.
- Escape is only possible after taking down the heavy mechanoid. The exit shaft is now a maintenance duct that leads to the engineering section of the statiom.
- Additional secret areas to find.

## Level C: Infestation

Begins at the bottom of the maitnenance shaft. Overal level layout as per Team17 design but rethemed into an engineering section:

- Central loop replaced with an information systems area clearly indicating that the cooling system for the primary reactor is offline and consequently running at minimum output.
- Right hand branch off the loop reimagined as storage areas with an alien infestation nest area.
- Increase verticality with lifts.
- Left hand branch off the loop reimagined as computer core areas, homage to System Purge level in AB3D1.
- Reynolds must find the two keys that permit entry to the power plant level to restart the sabotaged reactor.
- Further alien classes introduced.
- Additional secret areas to find.

## Level D: System Restart

Replacement level (TODO):
- Reynolds must restart the primary reactor.
- Restart results in the route back to the maintenance level becoming inacessible.
- Introduces the same mid level boss after reactor restart.
- Reveals that the station was attacked by an alien vessel, explaining the ring damage and lockdown
- The only route left is to push forwards, through the alien vessel.

## Level E: Exit Strategy (TODO)
- Reynolds must nagivage part of the confusing alien vessel in search for a way back to the docking ring or any other route out of the station.
- Alien vessel has multiple points of attachment to the station.
- Eventually finds the surface class teleport in the original station.

## Level F: Planetside (WIP)
- Original Level G, reworked slightly.
- Arrival at surface facility.
- Needs stronger overall theme and purpose.

## Level G: Ore Processing (WIP)
- Original Level F, reworked.
- Large hot central chasma part of a foundry-like structure.
- Further refinement needed.
