HOW TO:

			Incorporate Converted Texture Graphics
			============================================
	
	PLEASE NOTE:
	
		If you change texture graphics, and save over your existing texture file when converting
		them, you DO NOT NEED to follow this proceedure. Only if the name of the texture file
		has changed do you need to proceed.
	
	1. Run the GAMELINKER program.
	
	2. Select 'LOAD LINK FILE' from the menu and select
	
	MYDIR/INCLUDES/TEST.LNK
	
	3. Select GRAPHICS->SET TEXTURE FILENAME
		   
	4. Select the file you wish to load, presumably created using the 'FLOORCONVERT' utility.
	
	7. Select 'SAVE LINK FILE' and select the file
	
	MYDIR/INCLUDES/TEST.LNK.
	
	The new floor tile file will now be available in the level editor and the game itself!
