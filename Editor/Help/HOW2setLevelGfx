HOW TO:

				Change Wall Floor and Ceiling Graphics
				======================================
				
			THIS FILE INSTRUCTS ON USAGE OF THE LEVEL EDITOR. PLEASE
			READ THE LEVEL EDITOR KEY-GUIDE FOR BASIC INSTRUCTIONS.
				
				
	One of the more arcane and impenetrable stages of level editing is the defining of graphics
	for the walls, floors and ceilings of your levels. It is therefore imperative that the proper
	runes are cast and the traditional ceremonies carried out TO THE LETTER to avoid the incomparable
	wrath of the editor gods.
	
	Ok, so thats a lie. Graphics aren't that hard to include. However, it IS time consuming and rather
	dull, particularly when you're on level 15 of 16 and you really can't be arsed thinking too
	carefully about what you're doing, which is why I've included a shortcut or two for the lazier
	of you.
	
	
WALLS:
------

	Walls are the most complicated things to define graphics for. The main ingredients cast into the
	cauldron for a successful wall graphic are:
	
	1. Which wall file the graphics are to be drawn from
	2. Which part of the file is to be mapped onto the wall
	3. Whether the section of graphic is to be stretched so that an exact number of tiles of that
	   strip fit onto the wall OR
	4. Whether the section of graphic is to be squashed so that an exact number of tiles of that
	   trip fit into the wall OR
	5. Whether the strip of wall is to be drawn in strict 1x1 ratio regardless of the number of
	   tilings.
	6. Assorted eyes, toes, and the occsional spleen from small furry animals (optional)
	
	The procedure you should follow is this:
	
	1. Select the 'define wall graphic' icon. This can be found near the right hand end of the icon
	   bar on the middle row, and looks like a letter C with a red vertical bar and grey horizontal
	   bars.
	   
	2. Move the cursor into the edit area. The icon bar will vanish and be replaced with a rather
	   dotty and transparent vision of a wall graphic. Press 'v' to get a better look at it.
	
	3. Use the '<' and '>' keys to scroll along the wall graphic, or if you want to select the
	   next or previous graphic in series, press RSHIFT along with '<' or '>'. To change the
	   length of the tile (multiply or divide it by two, in fact), press Q or W. Once the section
	   of graphic visible corresponds to the part of the graphic you want pasted on the wall, move
	   on.
	   
	4. Is it important that the wall contains a whole number of tiles of the graphic selected? Such
	   cases arise with doors, where the door graphic must be stretched to fit the exact width of
	   the door, and so on. If you want to STRETCH OUT the wall graphic so that a whole number of
	   tiles covers the wall, pressing '-' toggles the effect on or off. Similarly, '+' toggles 
	   SQUASHING the graphic into the wall on/off.
	   
	5. Assuming all is OK, select the zone containing the wall to be pasted onto with the RIGHT
	   MOUSE BUTTON. Clicking on the LEFTMOST point of the wall as you would see it in the game
	   pastes the graphic onto that wall, eg:
	   
	   
	   		*---------------------* <- Clicking on THIS point...
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     | <- Changes THIS wall.
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
	   		|                     |
			*---------------------*
			
OTHER TOOLS:
------------

	You can grab the graphic settings from a wall by selecting the zone with the right mouse button,
	holding the mouse pointer near to the left hand end of the wall as above, and pressing 'g'.
	
	You can fill all the walls in a zone with your graphic by selecting the zone with the
	right mouse button and pressing 'f'.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:
-------------------

	It is possible for a single wall to have two different textures on it, depending upon which
	side you are on. For example, this SIDE ON VIEW of a step:
	
	
			_____________________
			|                   |
			|          Side A ->|
			|                   |_________________
			|                   .                |
			|                   .                |
			|                   .                |
			|                   .                |
			|                   .                |
			|___________________.                |
					    |                |
					    |<- Side B       |
					    |________________|
					    
	Hence you must define wall graphics from BOTH SIDES in cases like this.
	
	To help you in this task, pressing SHIFT and 'D' will redraw the level with all visible
	walls or steps still containing default graphics drawn in flickering grey, so you can see
	where you have missed.

	There is a corresponding DEFINE UPPER WALL GRAPHIC icon, which defines graphics for walls
	visible in the upper part of a zone (if it exists). It works in exactly the same way.
	
FLOORS and CEILINGS:
--------------------

	These are a little easier. Select the 'DEFINE FLOOR GRAPHIC' icon (near the right hand end of
	the scrollable icon bar; it looks like a letter C with a red bottom). Moving the cursor
	into the edit area replaces the icon bar with a picture of the graphic you are going to paste.
	
	Clicking in a zone with the RIGHT mouse button grabs the graphics already there.
	
	Q and W scale up or down the graphic by a factor of 2. This is shown next to the graphic by
	a number from -5 to +5. -5 is very, very big, and +5 very, very small.
	
	'<' and '>' scroll backwards and forwards through the available tiles.
	
	NB: When defining ceiling graphics, note that in addition to the 16 graphic textures, there
	    an additional option of having no roof (ie 'sky'). This cannot be scaled.
	    
	Clicking with the LEFT mouse button in a zone pastes the selected graphic into it. It is
	also possible to hold down the mouse button and 'smear' a texture over a number of zones without
	having to tediously click in each one. Useful for defining stairs and such like.
