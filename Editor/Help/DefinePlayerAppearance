HOW TO:

				DEFINE PLAYERS' APPEARANCE
				==========================
				
	To define the appearance of PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2 in the game, load the link file
	into the game linker as usual, then select
	
	PLAYERS -> DEFINE PLAYER STATS
	
	Click on the player you wish to define and select an 'alien' you want him to look like in
	the game. Simple as that.
