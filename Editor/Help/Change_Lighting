[HOW TO:

				Change Level Lighting
				=====================
				
	One of the most important aspects of AB3D as far as atmosphere is concerned is how the levels
	are lit.
	
	In AB3D, the walls and floors are smoothly shaded between brightness's defined at their corners.
	
	Each zone contains four 'layers' of brightnesses; a lower floor layer, a lower ceiling layer,
	an upper floor layer and an upper ceiling layer. Brightnesses are defined at the corners of
	zones, i.e. at the points which you selected to create the zone in the first place.
	
	NB: In the diagram below, where the two zones share two points, remember that you must define
	    brightnesses for the two shared points in BOTH zones individually. This may sound odd and
	    long-winded, but it allows you to have sharp edged bright and dark areas.

	    			*--------------*--------------*
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			|              #              |
	    			*--------------*--------------*
	    			
	The procedure for defining a layer of brightnesses is as follows:
	
	1. Select the appropriate icon. They are arranged in a line of four in the
	   middle row, fourth from the left end. Listed left to right, they are:
	   
	   UPPER ROOF BRIGHTNESS
	   UPPER FLOOR BRIGHTNESS
	   LOWER ROOF BRIGHTNESS
	   LOWER FLOOR BRIGHTNESS
	   
	2. Notice that as you click, three sliding bars appear, labelled BRIGHT, ANIM and DIST. These
	   values are clipboard values which will be pasted onto points.
	
	   BRIGHT:
		The default brightness value, ranging from -20 to +20. NEGATIVE numbers represent the
		same on-screen brightness as positive numbers, BUT they contribute nothing to the
		illumination of aliens, vector objects (e.g. the player's gun) and so on. Also, 
		remember that numbers close to 0 are BRIGHT, whereas numbers towards -20 or +20 are
		DIM.
		The reason for the positive/negative values is simple: the light-sourceing of objects
		doesn't work well without it! For example, a brightly lit room with glowing panels
		on the ceiling means that the light should be coming from above, and so aliens and
		guns should similarly be lit from above. In this case, the floor brightnesses should
		be set to -1, and the roof brightnesses to +1, so the room appears uniformly lit BUT
		aliens are lightsourced from above.
		
	   ANIM:
	   	There are several pre-defined lighting animations available:
	   	
	   	0 	= no animation
	   	1-5 	= 5 out of phase steady pulsing anims
	   	6-7	= Flickering effects.
	   	8-15    = Undefined at this time.
	   
	   DIST:
	   	This is used to describe how far towards the animation the brightness of the point is
	   	'pulled' from its default brightness. 0 means it doesn't animate at all, 15 means it
	   	animates completely, independent of the brightness it is given.
	   	
	   Set these values as desired.
	   
	3. Select a zone in which you want to change some brightnesses with the RIGHT mouse button, and
	   click on the point(s) you wish to set to the new values with the LEFT mouse button.
	   If you wish to grab brightness settings from a point, move the cursor near it and press 'g'.
	   
OTHER TOOLS:
------------

	There are several pre-defined settings which can be pasted into entire zones with one keypress.
	Simply select the zone with the right mouse button and press one of the following keys:
	
	1	Zone bright, lit from roof
	2	Zone bright, lit from floor
	3	Bright floor, dark roof
	4	Bright roof, dark floor
	5	Zone dark, lit from roof (i.e. what little light there is is coming from above)
	6	Zone dark, lit from floor (i.e. what little light there is is coming from below)
	7	Zone roof glowing (each roof point glowing in one of the five pulsing anims)
	8	Zone floor glowing
	9	Zone Glowing in sync (i.e. corresponding floor and ceiling points are glowing with
					the same animation)
	0	Zone Glowing out of sync (all floor and ceiling points pulse randomly and independently)
