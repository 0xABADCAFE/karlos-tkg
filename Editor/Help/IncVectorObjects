HOW TO:

				Incorporate Vector Objects
				==========================
				
	If you've spent the last three weeks thrashing around with the unwieldy and unfriendly
	vector object editors (sorry Charles :->) you'll probably want to see them in the game, whether
	as objects or aliens or guns or whatever.
	
	Before you can use them, you have to load them into the game link file:
	
	1. Load the link file into the game linker as usual.
	
	2. Select VECTORS -> SET VECTOR FILENAMES
	
	3. Click on a name to replace OR a blank space to load a new file.
	
	4. Select a file written out by the ANIMEDITOR program.
	
	Click on 'DONE' and save the link file again!
