HOW TO:

			Change Level Names
			==================
			
	Levels are described briefly by their names on the option screen when playing the game,
	and also saved game positions are referred to by the name of the level you are about to
	start when you load the position.
	
	To change these names, load the gamelinker program and load the link file
	in the usual manner.
	
	Select 
	
	LEVELS -> CHANGE LEVEL NAMES
	
	then click on level names and type to change them. Click on 'DONE' when you have finished
	and save the link file again.
