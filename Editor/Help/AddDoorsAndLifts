HOW TO:

				Add Doors and Lifts To Levels
				=============================
				
	No level would be complete without some doors (locked or otherwise) and lifts (stuck or
	otherwise) for the player to negotiate.
	
DEFINING A DOOR:
----------------

	Select the 'Define door' icon. This is fifth from the left on the bottom row, and depicts
	a red door with an arrow pointing upwards beneath it to show it opening.
	You will be presented with a bewildering array of options, including:
	
	DOOR NUM: X
		You are currently editing door X, which is a letter from A to P (16 doors). Pressing
		'<' and '>' with the cursor in the edit area scrolls through these values.
		NB: Holding down RSHIFT when pressing '<' or '>' not only moves to the previous or
		next door, but also copies all the settings from the current door to it. This is useful
		when most of the doors in your level are of the same type.
	
	Stays Open For (50=1 sec)
		This value represents the amount of time the door will remain open for after it reaches
		its full open height. By experimenting with this value you can create combinations of
		doors and switches which require the player to run across the map before the door
		closes again! Click on the value to change it.
	
	Opening Speed
		Opening and closing speeds can be more or less anything you like, but for example,
		an opening speed of 16 is fast, whilst an opening speed of 1 is very, very slow (useful
		for very big, heavy doors) Click on the value to change it.
	
	Closing Speed
		Same as above, but in the opposite direction.
		
	Opening SFX:
		This is the sound effect triggered by the door being opened. Click and type the number
		of a sound effect (0=no sound) which you have loaded into the game linker.
	
	Closing SFX:
		Same as above but triggered by the door starting to close.
		
	Open SFX:
		Similar to above, but triggered by the door REACHING its fully open state.
		
	Closed SFX:
		Ditto, but triggered by the door reaching its completely closed state.
		
	RAISE CONDITIONS:
		Plr touch+Space
			The player must come into contact with the door and press the space bar to trigger
			it into opening.
		Plr Touch
			The player only needs to touch the door to trigger it into opening.
		Bullet Touch
			NOT IMPLEMENTED IN CURRENT VERSION; DO NOT USE.
		Alien Touch
			NOT IMPLEMENTED IN CURRENT VERSION; DO NOT USE
		On Timeout
			As soon as the door becomes unlocked, or finishes closing, it will begin to
			open again.
		Never
			Fairly obvious; the door will never open. Not a lot of use, but included for
			completeness.
		
	LOWER CONDITIONS
		On Timeout
			Once the timer has expired (see above) the door will begin to close once more.
		Never
			Once open the door will never begin to close again.
		
	
PLACING A DOOR ON THE MAP
-------------------------

	1. Click on the 'define door' icon as above.
	
	2. Select the zone which you want to act as the door (i.e. its ceiling will rise and fall) with
	   the RIGHT mouse button.
	  
	3. Press 'r'. The letter of the door will appear roughly in the middle of the zone.
	
	4. This bit requires a bit of thought. Remember that the walls of zones face INWARDS, not outwards,
	   so you will now have to specify which walls in the surrounding zones you want to rise and
	   fall with the ceiling of the door zone:
	   
	   			1
	   	 ----------------*-------*-----------------
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 	ZONE X	 #       #	ZONE Y
	   	 		 #  DA   #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
	   	 		 #       #
                 ----------------*-------*-----------------
                 			  2
                 
	   In this case, where a corridor is interrupted by a door, zones X and Y each have ONE wall
	   which must appear to rise and fall with the ceiling marked 'DA'.
	   
	   To select these walls, click in, for example, zone X with the RIGHT mouse button. Then click
	   with the LEFT mouse button on the point at the LEFT END of the wall you wish to change.
	   
	   NB: The 'LEFT END' refers to the end of the wall which would be on the left when you looked at
	   it in the game from within zone X; i.e. point 1 in the diagram.
	   
	   Notice that the wall selected becomes blue. You can deselect a wall just by clicking on it
	   again.
	   
	   Repeat this process for all other zones bordering the door zone, (e.g. zone Y and point 2).
	   
	5. You have done it! The door will now rise and fall between the defined floor height and the
	   defined roof height of the zone in which it was placed. You can now place objects which hold
	   the door shut until collected, or put in aliens which hold it shut until killed, or anything!
	   
	NB: The list of settings for the door in the bottom right of the screen is NOT a clipboard; these
	    are the ACTUAL settings for the door. You can change the settings at any time before or after
	    placing the door, and the changes will take effect automatically.

DELETING A DOOR:
----------------

	Sometimes it may be necessary to delete a door from the map. The ONLY safe way to do this, boys
	and girls, is to follow this procedure:
	
	1. Click on the 'DEFINE DOOR' icon, and use < and > to reach the door you want to delete.
	
	2. Use the technique described above to toggle OFF all the blue walls in zones around the door.
	
	3. Select the door zone itself with the RIGHT mouse button and press 'r'. The door letter should
	   vanish.
	   
	NB: It is not possible to delete a zone which is either a door, or contains a wall bordering a door.
	    I made this so because every time I deleted a zone containing or bordering a door whilst
	    programming AB3D, the level corrupted irretrievably. I never did find out why, so I put in a
	    safety feature which prevents zones being deleted in such a situation. You MUST delete the
	    door before deleting neighbouring zones or the door zone itself.

DEFINING A LIFT:
----------------

	This is very, very similar to the above process, with the following changes:
	
	LOWER CONDITIONS:
		Plr touch+Space
			The player must come into contact with the lift and press the space bar to trigger
			it into coming down.
		Plr Touch
			The player only needs to touch the lift to trigger it into descending.
		On Timeout
			As soon as the lift becomes unlocked, or finishes rising, it will begin to
			lower again.
		Never
			The lift, once raised, will never descend.
	
	There is an additional setting, defining where the lift begins (at the top or the bottom of its
	movement) which can be set by pressing 't' or 'b' with the cursor in the edit area.
	
	Once a lift zone has been defined, in the same way as above, there is one extra piece of
	information you must give: the maximum height to which the lift rises. Define this by selecting the
	lift zone with the right mouse button
