HOW TO:

			Incorporate Converted Floor/Ceiling Graphics
			============================================
			
	PLEASE NOTE:
		You do not need to follow this procedure if you have converted your floor graphics and
		saved them over the existing texture file. Only if you have created a new file or changed
		the name or path of the old file do you need to proceed further.
	
	1. Run the GAMELINKER program.
	
	2. Select 'LOAD LINK FILE' from the menu and select
	
	MYDIR/INCLUDES/TEST.LNK
	
	3. Select GRAPHICS->SET FLOOR TILE FILENAME
		   
	4. Select the file you wish to load, presumably created using the 'FLOORCONVERT' utility.
	
	7. Select 'SAVE LINK FILE' and select the file
	
	MYDIR/INCLUDES/TEST.LNK.
	
	The new floor tile file will now be available in the level editor and the game itself!
