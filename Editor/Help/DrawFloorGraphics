HOW TO:

			Draw Floor Graphics
			===================
			
	Floor graphics MUST be drawn individually on 32 colour screens. They must be drawn as a
	64*64 pixel square located in the top left hand corner of the screen you draw them on.
	Each texture picture can have its own 32 colour palette independant of the other textures.
	There must be 16 of them before they can be used in the game, although you can always make
	16 copies of a 'default' texture, and replace them as you design new ones.
	
	They MUST be located, for compatability, in a single directory, and they MUST be called
	
	FLOOR.X
	
	where X is a number from 1 to 16.
