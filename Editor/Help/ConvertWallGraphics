HOW TO...

		Convert Wall Graphics.
		======================
		
Before graphics can be used in AB3DII they must be converted into a special, compressed
format.

NOTE: Wall graphics MUST obey the following rules:

1. They MUST be in 32 colours, IFF format. The palette you use is up to you,, but they must
   be drawn on a 32 colour screen.
   
2. They MUST be a power of 2 in height i.e. 16 (min),32,64,128 (max) pixels high. The height of
   the screen they are drawn on is unimportant, but the graphics themselves must comply to this
   rule.

It is a good idea to keep all the wall graphics you are going to use in a separate
directory, for example:

MYDIR
	WALLGFX
	
and to keep all the converted files in another directory e.g.

MYDIR
	WALLINC
	
If you have a picture which you want to convert, e.g.

MYDIR
	WALLGFX
		examplewall

then you should run the "WALLCONVERT" program provided. This program will prompt you for
a filename to load. Select your file, and follow the on screen instructions. You will be
asked for various parameters including height in pixels and width in pixels. Once conversion
is complete you will be prompted for a filename to save, e.g.:

MYDIR
	WALLINC
		examplewall

This file is in the correct format to be used in AB3DII. The program will automatically append
'.256wad' to the filename you supply, so if you click on an existing file to over-write,
make sure you delete the '.256wad' from the end before selecting OK or pressing RETURN.
